# Keybox Encryption - Public Commit

This is an encryption methodology and program developed with C# and Visual Studio to showcase the Keybox Encryption Algorithm. This encryption program is not perfect (e.g. issues with Unicode and some characters as it was meant to be an illustration). 

This program uses a multi-fragment-sampling algorithm and a shared key to encrypt plaintext to ciphertext.

*This project is built in 2 days somewhere in the 2012 for a mathematics/cryptography module.*
